            For an avid reader, novels are a treat and the main dilemma
the reader faces is selecting the next book to read once his
present one is completed. The aim of this paper is to solve this dilemma by coming up with SIMFIC 2.0 (Similarity in Fiction 2.0), a query by example search engine which retrieves similar books given a query book.
